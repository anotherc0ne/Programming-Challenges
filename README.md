# Programming-Challenges

From the Discord server:

"Greetings @Programming Challengers!
Since it is (apparently) semester break, that also means it's time to bring back the programming-challenges! (a little late, as is tradition)
The theme of this programming challenge is going to be "Short n' sweet, learn a new language!" so the challenges won't be long and drawn out, they won't be overly difficult, they will be very VERY simple. You have until the 1st of August to accomplish these. That's right everything is going to be given at once in one big burst and everything should be submitted at once. If doing this, MAKE SURE TO DO IT IN A LANGUAGE YOU HAVE NEVER USED BEFORE or have always "wanted to try"

So what are the challenges?

1) fizzbuzz: (If you don't know what a FizzBuzz is, do a quick google, but in short, write a program that will automatically print numbers out "1, 2, etc." however any number that is a multiple of 3 print "fizz" any number that is a multiple of 5 print "buzz" any number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5 print "fizzbuzz")
2) file input/file output, json format or yaml format: Read in the supplied people.json or people.yaml file, print out the name and home for both people, add a third person and save to file.
3) text parsing: User inputs a string of a certain formatting, convert it to human readable formatting. Input information is the due date for payment alongside how much in cents. YYYYMMDDCCCCCCCC with "CCCCCCCC" having leading 0's. EG: 2022121000004013 -> $40.13 due on 10/12/2022
4) text manipulation: Pig Latin. User inputs text, it gets converted in to pig latin. igpay atinlay isyay otnay ardhay otay ecodeday. ityay ecomesbay ardhay ifyay ethay irstfay etterlay isyay ayay owelvey. (Pig latin is not hard to decode. It becomes hard if the first letter is a vowel)
5) make a game of connect four. Simple."
